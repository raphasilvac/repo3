t message is very important. Since much of the power of Git is this flexibility in carefully crafting commits locally and then sharing them later, it is very powerful to be able to write three or four commits of logically seperate changes so that your work may be more easily peer reviewed. Since there is a seperation between committing and pushing those changes, do take the time to make it easier for the people you are working with to see what you've done by putting each logically seperate change in a seperate commit with a nice commit message so it is easier for them to see what you are doing and why.
